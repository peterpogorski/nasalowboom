Our app using the Google Maps Api can find and zoom into your current location using the built in GPS capabilities of your phone. Then by selecting the “sonic boom” or “low boom” the app displays the specific area that is effected by each of the booms. The app allows the user to overlay the impact areas of both the sonic and high boom. This gives a direct way to visually compare the impact zones which is important for civilian use. Furthermore the app will also play a sound clip of a sonic/low boom that would be similar to what would be heard in real life. Sound is considered a type of pollution and it is import that the effects of population is well know and regulated especially if it can directly cause physical damage. Notice how the boom is heard after the aircraft has flow over the target area, this is because the jet is travelling faster than the speed of sound thus the “boom” is heard after the jet has passed. The zones that that the apps display will correspond to the physical effects that a real boom would cause. For example a sonic boom from an aircraft at 500 feet caused over $300,000 of damages including window glass. (Page 8, EPA Effects of Sonic Boom and Similar Impulsive Noise on Structures)

Target Population (The features of the app could change depending on the user):

This app can be utilized by civilians wanting more information regarding the effects of sonic booms at specific geographical areas, such as over one's home. This can lead to an inform voted on new legislation that will regulate supersonic travel in the future or to just simply satisfy curiosity. 

Furthermore this app can be used by government officials that are targeting sonic travel. This is a relatively new and growing industry meaning reliable data is needed to create legislation that can regulate but also promote the use of supersonic travel. Government action can include an amendment to building codes in specific location such as near airports to require “sonic proof” windows as a precaution for public safety.

Lastly the app can be used by company's such as a new start up called Boom Aerospace who are developing an affordable super solution and one that can be used at a commercial scale. Use of new technology can effectively reduce the noise level of an aircraft producing a low boom instead of an sonic boom. The data that this app can generate will impact the design of such an aircraft as the company can visualize the effects of their aircraft in order to meet government regulations.
